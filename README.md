# MyRuns
It is a simple fitness app for Android.

It allows you to capture your runs and walks and view the stats on Google Maps. It uses sensors (viz. GPS, accelerometers) in the phone to infer your activity (e.g., running) in an automatic manner. We start by building out the UI then add GPS, Google maps, the inference model and database components. The app comprises a client that runs on the phone and a backend cloud component using Google App Engine. So you get first hand knowledge on implementing a native app on the phone and a cloud component. That's very cool.
